<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Whisk together oyster sauce, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar, Worcestershire,
    sesame oil, sugar, Sriracha, and garlic in a small bowl; set aside. Remove
    root ends from scallions and discard. Chop whites and light greens into
    2-inch pieces and quarter pieces lengthwise; set aside. Thinly slice
    remaining dark greens of scallions and reserve for garnish.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms in a
    single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on first side, about 3
    minutes. Stir and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms
    are tender and golden brown on both sides, about 4 more minutes. Add bok
    choy, carrots, sliced whites and light greens of scallions, and 1/4 cup
    water to pan with mushrooms. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables
    are just tender, about 3 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add udon noodles and remaining 1/4 cup water and cook, gently separating
    noodles with tongs or spoon. Add reserved oyster sauce mixture and cook,
    stirring constantly, until noodles and vegetables are well-coated, about 1
    minute. Divide among serving bowls and garnish with reserved sliced greens
    of scallions and optional garnishes. Serve immediately.
